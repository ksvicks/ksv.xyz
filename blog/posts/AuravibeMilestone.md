A small checkpoint worth noting: the **Auravibe** project is now running locally end-to-end.  
The basic flow works â€” authentication, pulling data, and showing a clean UI. Nothing fancy yet, but enough to prove the pieces connect.

The setup combines a lightweight **Spring backend** with a **React frontend**, wired to Spotify. For now, itâ€™s just local testing; next step is to plan a deployment to **auravibe.ksv.xyz**.

Not much more to share at this stage â€” keeping it minimal while I polish the core.
