So this just happened.

I’ve always been curious about hosting stuff on my own — running things from scratch, experimenting, and basically tinkering for fun. This week, I officially started setting up my **home server**.

🧠 **Why?**  
Not for any huge reason. Just wanted to try self-hosting a few things — maybe run some Java apps, host my website, play with Docker, Kubernetes, and just learn. No fancy setup. No production-grade stuff. Just raw experimenting and learning on the go.

💻 **The Machine**  
Got an **HP thin client** from a friend (I call him Wipro CEO ). It didn’t have WiFi and only had a **DisplayPort**, but luckily I had a spare DP cable and a monitor that supported it.

Installed **Ubuntu** on it right away.

🌐 **Getting Online**  
No built-in WiFi, so I improvised:

- I had an extra WiFi router lying around.
- Hooked that to my main internet router.
- Pulled an Ethernet cable from the secondary router to the thin client.

Boom — internet on my home server.

Later, the **Wipro CEO** suggested I just get a **WiFi dongle**, which would’ve been way simpler — and probably save some electricity by skipping that second router.

✍️ **Fun bit?**  
I'm writing and posting this blog **from the home server itself**. Just for the fun of it.

🛠️ **Today’s Setup:**

- Installed Ubuntu
- Ethernet networking via second router
- SSH enabled
- Static IP assigned
- Blog posted from the server 🎉

🧭 **Next on the list:**

- Docker & Docker Compose  
- Kubernetes (minikube or kind)  
- Self-hosted dashboard  
- Jenkins for CI/CD  
- Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)

This is just part 1. No roadmap, just vibes.
