Iâ€™ve always wanted a little online corner of my own. Over the years I spun up more prototypes than I can count, yet none ever made it past my local machineâ€”until I discovered **Material-UI**. With MUI I finally pushed a simple site to GitHub Pages, but updates stalled and that version went stale.

Fast-forward to todayâ€™s spark: **Shadcn**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Next.js**.  
The trio felt modern, andâ€”thanks to utility classesâ€”remarkably fast to iterate on. Most of the scaffolding, component wiring, and even some copy came straight from **ChatGPT sessions** . After a few late-night works, the fresh build is live.

Iâ€™m treating this launch as a _minimum lovable product_. Thereâ€™s plenty left to polishâ€”accessibility tweaks, LCP optimizations, slicker animationsâ€”but shipping beats perfect. Iâ€™ll document the exact workflow (prompt engineering + code snippets) in a follow-up post.

Thanks for stopping by, and welcome to the rebooted site!
